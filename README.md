Leveraging Social Media Data for Political Insight
==================================================

Project Overview
----------------

This project focuses on analyzing Twitter data from the 2016 election year using advanced machine learning and data processing techniques. Key areas of analysis include sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and classification, with a particular focus on tweets related to Donald Trump. The objective is to uncover insights on public opinion, influential topics, and their correlation with retweet counts.

Data Sources
------------

*   **Twitter Dataset (2016)**: 10 months of Twitter data, each containing ~74 million rows with attributes like text, tweet ID, user ID, date, and retweet details.
    

Methodology
-----------

1.  **Data Preparation**: Merging, cleaning, and preprocessing data.
    
2.  **Sentiment Analysis**: Using Vader for sentiment classification.
    
3.  **Topic Modeling**: Applying Top2Vec for discovering key topics.
    
4.  **Prediction Models**:
    
    *   Regression Model: Predicting retweet count.
        
    *   Classifier Models: Predicting dominant topics based on various features.
        

Key Results
-----------

*   **Sentiment Analysis**: Insights into the sentiments that drive retweets.
    
*   **Topic Modeling**: Identified key topics in Trump-related tweets.
    
*   **Predictive Models**: Achieved ~93% accuracy in predicting dominant topics.
    

Future Work
-----------

*   Expanding the analysis to the full dataset for better predictive accuracy.
    
*   Incorporating additional features like likes and user information for enhanced models.
